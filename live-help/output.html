<div class="panel" data-module="lfo"><h2>LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator)</h2>
<p>Used optionally to modulate the Oscillators’ frequencies and the cut-off frequency of the Filter, to create vibrato effects or slow sweeping timbre changes. The Mod Wheel (left) can be used to adjust the amount of modulation, and a fixed amount can be set which can be made to come in gradually after a delay when a note is played, adding an expressive quality. Further expressiveness can be added by making this delay shorter the harder you press the note.</p>
<p>Noise can be used to modulate, which gives ragged or glitchy effects, especially with brown noise set by the Global&gt;Noise selector.</p>

<p>Controls the delay before the modulation set by the Level control kicks in, zero = no delay. Can be combined with the Expression control to make the delay velocity sensitive.</p>

<p>The octave range of the frequencies, broadly in feet as in organ stops, although this is just a guide. Higher numbers gives higher tones.</p>

<h3>Fine Tune</h3>
<p>Allows fine tuning of the frequency offset by up to plus or minus a semitone. Useful for creating detune effects, where the oscillators are slightly out of tune giving depth and movement to the sound.</p>

</div><div class="panel" data-module="loudnessEnvelope"><h2>Amp Envelope</h2>
<p>This envelope shapes how the loudness of the note changes with time after a key press.</p>
<p>When a key is pressed the envelope rises linearly to its maximum level in the time set by Attack, then decays exponentially to the Sustain level in the time set by Decay. When the key is released, the envelope reduces exponentially to zero in the time set by Release. Velocity allows expression by making the envelope levels proportional to how hard the key is pressed. The Expression control adds further expression by shortening the Attack time the harder the key is pressed.</p>
<div class="control" data-module="loudnessEnvelope" data-control="attackSeconds">
<h3>Attack</h3>
<p>The time taken for the envelope to rise linearly to it’s maximum level. The Expression control can also affect this by shortening it when the key is pressed harder.</p>
